<p>The LQ is currently a standard model in work describing the effects of radioactivity on tissue response and cell survival.</p>
<p>The LQ model can be used in changing treatment regimens that are biologically equivalent, calculating compensation for interruptions in radiotherapy, and combining treatment modalities (X-rays, protons).</p>
<p>Expression form of The LQ is described by cell survival (S):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">[LQ SF ]= exp(&alpha;D + &beta;D<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>where &alpha; and &beta; are the LQ parameters</p>
<p>The survived cells are calculated&nbsp;after <strong>n</strong> fractions and dose of each fraction <strong>d</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">[LQ S(d)]<sup>n</sup> = exp<sup>-n(&alpha;d +&nbsp;&beta;d^2)</sup></p>

<p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>
<p>In a routine clinical environment, it can be difficult to determine the most effective fractionation for a patient undergoing treatment. Calculating BED allows a physical dose to be converted into a dose that describes the biological effect of the radiation on tumor or normal tissue to create quality radiation plans that reduce errors and treat patients faster. Here, we present a BED calculator and a brief background on the topic and its applications.</p>
<p><strong>Biologically Effective Dose&mdash;The Basics</strong></p>
<p>BED - Biologically Effective Dose, as a linear-quadratic (LQ)-based formula, in particular the cell survival (S) in radiation treatments with n fractions, d dose per fractions delivered in tissues characterized with LQ parameters &alpha; and &alpha;/&beta;.</p>
<p>The BED that is used for evaluating a called &ldquo;biological dose,&rdquo; and is written as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;"><em>BED= D [1+ d /(&alpha;/&beta;)]</em></p>
<p>As an inherent part of the LQ SF model, the origin of BED is explained in the following way. The radiation cell kill (or effect, E) can be expressed as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;"><em>E =&nbsp;(&alpha;D +&nbsp;&beta;D<sup>2</sup>)</em></p>
<p>The equation determines the biological effect (E) as a function of dose (D), where is D=n.d , the linear dose damage response (&alpha;), and the quadratic dose response in tissue (&beta;).</p>
<p>&alpha; represents events per cell per unit dose (unit is Gy-1), characterizing the mechanism of death mainly at low doses, while &beta; represents events per cell per unit dose squared (unit is Gy-2), characterizing the main lethal mechanism at high doses.The &alpha;/&beta; ratio represents the dose at which linear and quadratic components of cell killing are equal for a given tissue. A low &alpha;/&beta; ratio (~3) indicates a late response, and a high ratio (~10) suggests an early response in tissue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">BED = E/&alpha; = n.d(1 + d/(&alpha;/&beta;))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Biological Effective Dose (BED) calculator is an important tool in understanding tumor and normal tissue response across different treatment modalities an fractionation schemes.</p>
<p><strong>The treament regimen change</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basics is based on LQ ( The Linear </strong><strong>Quadratic Model)</strong></p>
<p>In using the LQ model, it is assumed that each fraction has an equal effect, thus for a fractionated regime (n fractions of size d):</p>
<p><em>[LQ S(d)]<sup>n</sup></em><strong> =&nbsp;</strong><em>exp<sup>-n(&alpha;d +&nbsp;&beta;d^2)</sup></em></p>
<p>It is further assumed that if different fractionation regimes:</p>
<p>For example: n<sub>1</sub> fractions of size d<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> fractions of size d<sub>2</sub> are isoeffective for a given tissue, they lead to the same surviving fraction (SF). Thus we have:</p>
<p><em>LQ S(n<sub>1</sub>,d<sub>1</sub>)= LQ S(n<sub>2</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>)</em></p>
<p><em>n<sub>1</sub>(&alpha;d<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp;&beta;d<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>) =&nbsp;n1(&alpha;d<sub>2</sub> +&nbsp;&beta;d<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)</em></p>
<p>The BED expression was a result of a mathematical derivation of the exponential part of the LQ S model for treatments with n fractions and dose per fraction d.</p>
<p><em>BED =&nbsp;&nbsp;E/&alpha; = n.d(1 + d/(&alpha;/&beta;))</em></p>
<p>&alpha; represents events per cell per unit dose (unit is Gy-1), characterizing the mechanism of death mainly at low doses, while &beta; represents events per cell per unit dose squared (unit is Gy-2), characterizing the main lethal mechanism at high doses.The &alpha;/&beta; ratio represents the dose at which linear and quadratic components of cell killing are equal for a given tissue. A low &alpha;/&beta; ratio (~3) indicates a late response, and a high ratio (~10) suggests an early response in tissue.</p>
<p>This means that two adjacent tissues with different &alpha;/&beta; ratios, each receiving the same dose and fractionation, will be associated with different values of BED. BED can be used for comparing the biological effects of various radiotherapy schedules and for different types of radiotherapy. For example, if the biological effect of a total dose D1 derived in n1 fractions of dose d1 each is equivalent to the biological effect of a dose D2 in n2 fractions of dose d2, then it follows that the BEDs will be equal.</p>
<p>In case, we have 2 treatment regimens with biologically effective doses, so the two treatment regimens have equivalent biological effectiveness and have the same BED</p>
<p><em>n<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub>[ 1 + d<sub>1</sub>/(&alpha;/&beta;)] = n<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2</sub>[ 1 + d<sub>2</sub>/(&alpha;/&beta;)]</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this relationship and knowing the values of n<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, and d<sub>2</sub>, the constant &alpha;/&beta; can be determined for the particular tissue and used in the equation to predict other isoeffective treatment schedules</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Convert radiotherapy regimen to 50 Gy/25 fractions to a regimen equivalent to a fraction of 3 Gy for breast cancer tissue? &alpha;/&beta; of breast cancer tissue is 4 - 4.5 Gy, &alpha;/&beta; of healthy breast tissue, chest wall is 3 - 3.5 Gy. Finding the dose fraction of the equivalent treatment regimen.</p>
<p>Using the treament regimen change, 2 treatment regimens have equivalent biological effectiveness and have the same BED.</p>
<p><em>n<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub>[ 1 + d<sub>1</sub>/(&alpha;/&beta;)] = n<sub>2</sub>d<sub>2</sub>[ 1 + d<sub>2</sub>/(&alpha;/&beta;)]</em>&nbsp;(1)</p>
<p>50(1 + 2/4.5) = n<sub>2</sub>.3(&nbsp;1 + 3/4.5)</p>
<p>Finally, the number of dose fractions of the equivalent treatment regimen is n<sub>2</sub> =14.</p>
<p><strong>Correction for errors</strong></p>
<p>Dosimetric errors in delivering the prescribed dose per fraction made early in a treatment can be corrected by modifying the dose per fraction and total dose given subsequently to discovery of the error, using the LQ model to calculate the correcting doses which should be completed within the same overall time as originally prescribed.</p>
<p>The Mike Joiner showed how to calculate the dose per fraction used to bring the treatment back exactly to planned tolerance simultaneously for all tissues and tumour involved, following either hyperfractionated or hypofractionated errors made initially, without the need to know any &alpha;/&beta; values.</p>
<p>The Mike Joiner method definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The planned total dose is:</li>
</ul>
<p>D<sub>p</sub> Gy at d<sub>p</sub> Gy/fraction</p>
<ul>
<li>The dose given erroneously is:</li>
</ul>
<p>D<sub>e</sub> Gy at d<sub>e </sub>Gy/fraction</p>
<ul>
<li>The dose required to complete the course is:</li>
</ul>
<p>D<sub>c</sub> Gy at d<sub>c</sub> Gy/fraction in N<sub>c</sub> fractions</p>
<p>Defining planned treatment as d<sub>p</sub> Gy per fraction to a total dose D<sub>p</sub> Gy,suppose the initial error is d<sub>e</sub> Gy per fraction given to a total of D<sub>e</sub> Gy. Using the LQ model to describe all isoeffect relationships between total dose and dose per fraction for the tumour and the normal tissues, then the compensating dose per fraction of d<sub>c</sub> Gy to a total dose of D<sub>c</sub> Gy are given by the simple formulae:</p>
<p><em>D<sub>c</sub>= D<sub>p</sub> -D<sub>e&nbsp;</sub></em></p>
<p><em>=&gt; d<sub>c</sub> = (D<sub>p</sub>d<sub>p</sub> - D<sub>e</sub>d<sub>e</sub>)/(D<sub>p</sub> - D<sub>e</sub>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>For example: According to the plan, a patient must have 30 fractions, each day with each dose being 1.8Gy. But due to an error, the patient received the first 5 fractions with each dose being 2Gy. How is the treatment regimen adjusted so that the patient still receives the same treatment effect on the tumor and protection on healthy organs as the initia treatment?</p>
<p>We have the formulae about correction for error in clinical practice:</p>
<p>d<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;= (D<sub>p</sub>d<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;- D<sub>e</sub>d<sub>e</sub>)/(D<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;- D<sub>e</sub>)</p>
<p>We also have D<sub>p&nbsp;</sub>= n<sub>p</sub>.d<sub>p</sub> = 54 Gy; D<sub>e</sub>&nbsp;= n<sub>e</sub>.d<sub>e</sub> = 10 Gy</p>
<p><em>=&gt; </em>d<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;= (D<sub>p</sub>d<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;- D<sub>e</sub>d<sub>e</sub>)/(D<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;- D<sub>e</sub>)&nbsp;= (54.1,8 - 10.2)/(54 - 10) = 1,75 (Gy)</p>
<p>D<sub>c</sub>= D<sub>p</sub> -D<sub>e</sub>= 54-10 =44 Gy =&gt; n<sub>c</sub>=25</p>
<p>Finally, we have the dose required to complete the course is d<sub>c</sub>=1,75 Gy ; n<sub>c</sub>= 25 fractions</p>
